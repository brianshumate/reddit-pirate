reddit.com Pirate Translation
=============================

If you select to enable all languages on [reddit.com](http://reddit.com/) you'll notice that there is a support for the *Pirate* language.

This is what I submitted to [keysersosa](http://www.reddit.com/user/keysersosa) in the form of a GNU gettext translation of approximately 80% of the reddit interface strings into (admittedly weak in places) pirate-speak.

Yes, it was my fault. I am [shumizzle](http://www.reddit.com/user/shumizzle), and I created most of the translation one evening right before International Talk Like a Pirate Day. It was used as the default language on that day for a few years and people generally dug it. :)
